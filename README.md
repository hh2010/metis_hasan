## Hasan's Metis Classwork Repository

This is the repository for all my [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com) bootcamp
work that cannot standalone as its own project.

The directory structure is below:
* [**Challenges**](https://github.com/hh2010/metis_hasan/tree/master/challenges)
  * We were required to do 9 challenge sets
  * The ones that involved creating a Jupyter notebook are saved here
* [**Investigations**](https://github.com/hh2010/metis_hasan/tree/master/inv)
  * We were required to do three "investigation" presentations of our choosing
  * My investigation on [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) is wrapped into the [hunl](https://github.com/hh2010/hunl) repo
  * The other investigations are saved here
* [**Lecture**](https://github.com/hh2010/metis_hasan/tree/master/lecture)
  * We had lecture every day in class
  * If we did any work together (usually in Jupyter notebook), it is saved here
* [**Pairs**](https://github.com/hh2010/metis_hasan/tree/master/pairs)
  * We did paired programming problems every morning
  * To the extent I worked on the paired problems in a Jupyter notebook
    or Python script, it is saved in here
* [**Projects**](https://github.com/hh2010/metis_hasan/tree/master/projects)
  * We did five Python projects over the course of 12 weeks
  * The [first project](https://github.com/hh2010/metis_hasan/tree/master/projects/01-mta) was mostly an introduction to Python / Pandas
  * My [second project](https://github.com/hh2010/metis_hasan/tree/master/projects/02-comps) involved using linear regression to determine EBITDA
    multiples based on features of a public company.  This is not yet ready
    to standalone.
  * My [third](https://github.com/hh2010/malware_classify), fourth, and fifth
    projects are in their own repos
  * Each project has a blog post on [my website](http://www.hasanhaq.com/blog)
